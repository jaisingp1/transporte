CRITICAL RULE: The entire response MUST be in the same language as the user's question. The app supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish. Detect the language of "{{question}}" and respond accordingly.

Task: Based on the provided Data, generate a response in JSON format. The JSON object must have two keys: "view" and "message".

Instructions for the JSON object:
1.  "view": This key tells the application what to display. Its value must be one of the following:
    - "TABLE": Use this when the Data contains multiple machines.
    - "CARD": Use this when the Data contains a single machine.
    - "NONE": Use this when the Data is empty (no results found).

2.  "message": This key contains the natural language response for the user.
    - If "view" is "TABLE", the message should be a brief overview (e.g., "Encontré X máquinas. Puedes ver los detalles en la tabla.").
    - If "view" is "CARD", the message should be a concise summary of that single machine.
    - If "view" is "NONE", the message should inform the user that no results were found (e.g., "No encontré máquinas que coincidan con tu búsqueda.").

Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
